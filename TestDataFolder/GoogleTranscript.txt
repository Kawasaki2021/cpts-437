[60 - 120]: are you better off than you were four years ago when it comes to the economy do you believe Americans are
[120 - 180]: president Trump will give you 2 minutes first of all I have no sales tax that's an incorrect statement she knows that we're doing tariffs so in other countries other countries are going to finally after 75 years pay us back for all that we've done for the world and the Tariff will be substantial in some cases I took him billions and billions of dollars as you know from China in fact they never took the Tariff off because it was so much money they can't it would totally destroy everything that they've set out to do they're taking in billions of dollars from China and other places they've left the tariffs on when I had it I had tariffs and yet I had no inflation look we've had a terrible economy because inflation has which is really known as a country Buster it breaks up countries we have inflation like very few people have ever seen before probably the worst in our nation's history we were at 21% but that's being generous because many things are 5678 80% higher than they were just a few years ago this has
[180 - 240]: nobody's ever seen anything like it we made ventilators for the entire world we got gowns we got masks we did things that nobody thought possible and people give me credit for rebuilding the military they give me credit for a lot of things but not enough credit for the great job we did with the pandemic but the only jobs they got were bounced back jobs he's with jobs bounce back and it bounced back and it went to their benefit but I was the one that created them they know it and so does everybody else vice president so Donald Trump has no plans for you and when you look at his economic plan it's all about tax breaks for the richest people I am offering what I described as an opportunity economy and the best Economist in our country if not the world have reviewed our relative plans for the future of America what Goldman Sachs has said is that Donald Trump's plan would make the economy worst mine would strengthen the economy what the
[240 - 300]: exclamation point when we know that she was responsible for lacking and not giving us transparency about the origins of covid president first of all they bought their chips from Taiwan we hardly make chips anymore because of philosophies like they have and policies like they have I don't say her because she has no policy everything that she believes three years ago and 4 years ago is out the window she's going to My Philosophy now in fact I was going to send her a mega hat she's going to My Philosophy but if she ever got elected she changed it and it will be the end of our country she's a Marxist everybody knows she's her father's professor and economics and he taught her well but when you look at what she's done to our country and when you
[300 - 360]: in the parking lot she didn't want that her husband didn't want that a 12 or 13 year old survivor of incest being forced to carry a pregnancy to term they don't want that and I pledge to you when Congress passes a bill to put back in place the protections of Roe v Wade as president of the United States I will proudly sign it into law but understand if Donald Trump were to be re-elected he will sign a National Abortion band understanding and his project 2025 there would be a National Abortion of that would be monitoring your pregnancy is your miscarriages I think the American people believe that certain freedoms and particularly the freedom to make decisions about one's own body should not be made by the government thank you vice president because
[360 - 420]: we've been personally affected by The Surge of fentanyl in our country that bill would have put more resources to allow us to prosecute transnational criminal organizations for trafficking in guns drugs in human beings but you know what happened to that bill Donald Trump got on the phone called up some folks in Congress and said kill the bill and you know why because he preferred to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem and understand this comes at a time where the people of our country actually need a leader who engages in Solutions who actually addresses the problems at hand but what we have in the former president is someone who would prefer to run on a problem and set up fixing a problem and I'll tell you something he's going to talk about immigration a lot tonight even when it's not the subject that is being raped and I'm going to actually do something really unusual and I'm going to invite you to attend one of Donald Trump's rallies cuz it's a really interesting thing to watch
[420 - 480]: 818,000 jobs that they said they created turned out to be a fraud president Trump thank you I'll let you know I think this is so rich coming from someone who has been prosecuted for National Security crimes economic crimes election interference has been found liable for sexual assault and his next big court appearance is in November at his own criminal where each person stands on the issue of what is important about respect for the rule of law and respect for law enforcement the former vice president called for defunding federal law enforcement 45,000 agents
[480 - 540]: Cornerstone of our democracy and the role of a president in a moment of Crisis Mr President on January 6th you told your supporters to March to the capital you said you would be right there with them the country in the world saw what played out of the capital that day the officers coming under attack AIDS In The West Wing say you watched it unfold on television off the Oval Office you did send out tweets but it was more than two hours before you send out that video message telling your supporters to go home is there anything you regret about what you did on that day you just said a thing that isn't covered peacefully and patriotically I said during my speech not later on peacefully and patriotically and nobody on the other side was killed Ashley was shot by an out of control police officer that should have
[540 - 600]: I have talked with military leaders some of whom work with you and they say you're a disgrace and when you then talk in this way in a presidential debate and deny what over and over again are court cases you have lost because you did in fact lose that election it leads one to believe that perhaps we do not have in the candidate to my right the temperament or or the ability to not be confused about fact that's deeply troubling and the American people deserve better I'll give you 1 minutes ago it wasn't why is it blowing up he said because you need
[600 - 660]: I have a good relationship and they respect your president okay they respect me they don't respect Biden how would you respect him why for what reason he hasn't even made a phone call in 2 years to put hasn't spoken to anybody they don't even try and get it that is a war that's dying to be settled I will get it settled before I even become president if I win when I'm President elect and what I'll do is I'll speak to one I'll speak to the other I'll get them together that would have never happened and in fact when I saw Putin after I left unfortunately left because our country has gone to hell but after I left when I saw him building up soldiers he did it after I left I said oh he must be negotiating it must be a good strong point of negotiation well it wasn't because Biden had no idea how to talk to him he had no idea how to stop it and now you have millions of people dead
[660 - 720]: who wants to be president who has consistently over the course of his career attempted to use race to divide the American people you know I do believe that the vast majority of the snow that we have so much more in common than what separates us and we don't want this kind of approach that is just constantly trying to divide us and especially by race and let's remember how Donald Trump started he was a building and he was investigated because he refused to rent property to black families let's remember this is the same individual who took out a full-page ad in the New York Times calling for the execution
[720 - 780]: into the United States because of these people what they have given to China is unbelievable but we're not going to let that we'll put tariffs on those cars so they can't come into our country because they will kill the United Auto Workers and any auto worker whether it's in Detroit or South Carolina or any other place what they've done to business and Manufacturing in this country is horrible we have nothing because they they refuse you know Biden doesn't go after people because supposedly China paid millions of dollars he's afraid to do it between him and his son they get all this money from Ukraine they get all this money from all of these different countries and then you wonder why is he so loyal to this why is it why did he get three and a half million dollars from the mayor of moscow's wife why did he get why did she pay him three and a half million dollars this is a cricket Administration and the selling our country down the tubes president Trump thank you
